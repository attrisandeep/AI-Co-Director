**Review Report:**

**Genre Assessment:**
The script embodies the essence of Film Noir, with its dimly lit setting, morally ambiguous characters, and intense emotional undercurrents. The atmosphere is thick with tension, and the dialogue captures the haunting quality typical of the genre. However, to elevate it further, certain conventions of Film Noir should be emphasized.

**Narrative Flow and Dialogue Authenticity:**
The narrative flows well overall, drawing the audience into the characters' inner conflicts. The dialogue is compelling, with moments rich in subtext, but there are instances where it can be sharpened to enhance authenticity. Characters need to exude a more distinct blend of cynicism and charm—a hallmark of noir dialogue.

**Character Development:**
The characters exhibit some depth, particularly Sarah, who wrestles with her past decisions. However, James feels somewhat one-dimensional. Their motivations feel slightly unclear, which can detract from viewer engagement. Both characters should display more nuanced layers of vulnerability and resolve.

**Actionable Recommendations:**

1. **Enhance Character Backstories:** Provide brief flashbacks or inner thoughts revealing key events that shaped Sarah and James. This will deepen their motivations and intensify their current dilemmas. For example, hint at a specific betrayal or trauma that links them to their "ghosts."

2. **Tighten Dialogue for Authenticity:** Infuse more cynical, witty exchanges typical of Film Noir. For instance, revise the line "You’re always late, James," to something with more edge, such as "You're lucky I keep my coffee hot for your drama."

3. **Strengthen Visual Descriptors:** Intensify the atmospheric details to create a more immersive environment. Instead of "the coffee shop is dimly lit," describe it as "the flickering light bulb casts long shadows across the worn wooden tables, mirroring the tension in the air."

4. **Utilize Symbolism:** Incorporate symbols that reinforce key themes—perhaps the coffee shop's coffee could symbolize the bitterness of their situation, or the flickering lights might represent their fragile hope. This layered symbolism is a staple of successful Film Noir.

5. **Pacing Adjustments:** Consider varying the pacing. The tension is palpable, but it may benefit from moments of heightened urgency. Adding a scene where they narrowly escape a potential threat could quicken the tempo and raise the stakes.

By refining these elements while keeping the core narrative intact, the script will resonate more profoundly with audiences and preserve the captivating essence of Film Noir.
